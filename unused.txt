* At this point in time, you must be connected to Twingate to connect to das homelab.



To access das homelab, you have a couple options. When on eduroam or grizzlyguest, you *must* either:
- be connected to Twingate (instructions below),
- be connected to a 3rd-party VPN, like NordVPN or Private Internet Access, or
- be connected to the Brandenburg WiFi network that das homelab itself is connected to.
No specific things are required to access the homelab when not on eduroam or grizzlyguest.


Twingate setup instructions:
1. If on a desktop or laptop, go to https://twingate.com/download/ and download the Twingate client for your OS. If on an iPhone, iPad, or Android device, download the Twingate client from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
2. Open the Twingate client. If/when it prompts to allow a VPN profile, click allow. When it asks for the network name, enter "noahsroberts" only.
3. When presented with the log-in page, choose one of the "Log in with..." services that uses the same email as the one above. If there is an email mismatch, signing in will fail. 
4. Profit. 

Notes:
- Later conections to Twingate will not require you to enter the network name, but you will need to sign in every week or so. It's annoying, but it can't really be changed. 
- When connected, your device might say that you are connected to a VPN. Twingate isn't a VPN though, but requires the installation of a VPN profile to work. Ask Noah if you would like to know the details of why this is.

If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to message Noah.



If you're having issues with the link, refer to the "To access the homelab" section above.
